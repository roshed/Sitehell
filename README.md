## For Whom?
Yon controller is created for people who need that thing, but can't create it or don't have enough time to create it yourself.
 
Sitehell help with editing sites by means of editing one file rather than edit everyone subpag, so you really gain a lot of time.

## Introduction
To configure Sitehell open file index.php in main folder,
$dbip = '#'; // ip database

$dbuser = '#'; // user database

$dbpass = '#'; // password database

$dbselect = '#'; // select database


$firstTable = 'index'; // First table in mysql use with $user[''];

$secondTable = ''; // Second table in mysql use with $user[''];


$first = 'view'; // First folder

$second = 'layout'; // Second folder

$three = 'index'; // Third folder

//etcetra etcetra

$controller = 'index'; //file name, what you want to load. without .PHP

$top = 'header.php'; // Top of site, file name

$bot = 'footer.php'; // Bottom of site, file name
